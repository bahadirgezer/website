# Undergraduate Program

The undergraduate program in Computer Engineering is designed so that students have a balanced background in computer hardware, software, and computer applications, and that they can adapt themselves to the rapidly changing technologies in their professional carreers. Emphasis is on the engineering aspects of the field such as the analysis and design of both hardware and software systems.

## Notes for Foreign Students

Instead of the course TK 221 the foreign students should take TKF 111 or TKF 112, and instead of the course TK 222, the same students should take TKF 211, TKF 212, TKF 217 or TKF 218, depending on the interview with the Department of Turkish Language and Literature. For more information, please visit the website for [Turkish Courses for Foreigners](https://turkishliterature.boun.edu.tr/en/node/269).

Similarly, instead of the courses HTR 311 and HTR 312, the foreign students should take HTR 405 and HTR 406, respectively.
