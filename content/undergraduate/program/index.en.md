## Overview

The undergraduate program in Computer Engineering is designed so that students have a balanced background in computer hardware, software, and computer applications, and that they can adopt themselves to rapidly changing technology in their professional carrier. The emphasis is on the engineering aspects such as analysis and design of both hardware and software systems.

Boğaziçi University Computer Engineering Undergraduate Program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of [ABET]().

## Educational Objectives

We agree on four educational objectives for our undergraduate program.

Objective (1)
: _Pursue the practice of computer engineering in various industrial sectors, not only at the national but also at the international level._

Objective (2)
: _Pursue advanced degrees and engage in research activities in world-class institutions._

Objective (3)
: _Pursue a life-long career of personal and professional growth in the rapidly changing computing world with ethical consciousness and global awareness._

Objective (4)
: _Be able to assume innovative, executive, leadership, and entrepreneurial roles in their careers._

These educational objectives were derived from our [mission statement](/about/mission/#department-of-computer-engineering), which are in line with the mission statements of the Boğaziçi University and the Faculty of Engineering.

## Student Outcomes

Student outcomes of our undergraduate program describe what students are expected to know and be able to do by the time of graduation. These relate to the knowledge, skills, and behaviors that students acquire as they progress through the program. By agglomerating ABET's required general outcomes (numbered (1-7), ABET's additional computer engineering related outcomes, and our program-specific outcomes (numbered 8-11), we state a total of eleven student outcomes for our undergraduate program as follows:

Student Outcome (1)
: _An ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics_

Student Outcome (2)
: _An ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors_

Student Outcome (3)
: _An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences_

Student Outcome (4)
: _An ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts_

Student Outcome (5)
: _An ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives_

Student Outcome (6)
: _An ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions_

Student Outcome (7)
: _An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies_

Student Outcome (8)
: _Knowledge of probability and statistics, including applications appropriate to computer engineering_

Student Outcome (9)
: _Knowledge of mathematics through differential and integral calculus and basic sciences_

Student Outcome (10)
: _Knowledge of engineering topics including computing science necessary to analyze and design complex electrical and electronic devices, software, and systems containing hardware and software components_

Student Outcome (11)
: _Knowledge of discrete mathematics_

## Curriculum

The course requirements for the bachelor of science degree in Computer Engineering total a minimum of 145 credit-hours of formal course work. The first five semesters of the program are common to all students. Starting in the sixth semester, students take elective courses in order to specialize in the subject according to their interests.
