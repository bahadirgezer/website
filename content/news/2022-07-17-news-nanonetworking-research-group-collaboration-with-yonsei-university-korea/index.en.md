Dr. H. Birkan Yılmaz, a member of the Nanonetworking Research Group (NRG)  at the Department of Computer Engineering is conducting a TUBITAK project titled Molecular Signal Source Localization for Underwater and Medical Applications that focuses on developing macro and mesoscale testbeds to solve localization problems from an MC-inspired perspective through simulators for localization applications and analytical models for the molecular signal propagation. A mesoscale localization testbed that provides a mock circulatory network similar to the human circulatory system has been developed for the use in medical applications such as cancer cell localization, targeted drug delivery, and intra-body NEMS/MEMS coordination.

Within the scope of this project, synergy, and collaboration meetings were held at  Yonsei University, Korea. The Boğaziçi team consisted of Prof. H. Birkan Yılmaz, MSc candidate Azar Hadi, and an undergraduate student Yusuf Erdem Nacar who presented the details of the project to the Chae-Lab at Yonsei University to discuss potential collaborations. A memorandum of understanding has been agreed upon to enhance future collaborations.
