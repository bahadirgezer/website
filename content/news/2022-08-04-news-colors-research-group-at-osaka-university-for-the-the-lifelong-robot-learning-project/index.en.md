Professor Minoru Asada, administrative director of the Symbiotic Intelligent
Systems Center (SisReC) of the Institute for Open and Transdisciplinary Research
Initiatives, Associate Professor Emre Uğur, the head of The Cognition, Learning
and Robotics (CoLoRs) lab at Bogazici University Computer Engineering Department
and Professor Erhan Öztop, who is a Specially Appointed Professor at Osaka
University in the Symbiotic Intelligent Systems Center (SisReC) of Institute for
Open and Transdisciplinary Research Initiatives (OTRI) and co-directs Ozu
Robotics Laboratory at Ozyegin University Science Department are together
collaboration in several projects including the following:

The lifelong robot learning project (which is also supported by the Japan
Society for the Promotion of Science with the project titled Human-like
Continual Robot Learning based on Three-level Computational Energy Cost
Regulation) focuses on computational energy cost (CEC) constraints in robots
inspired by the organisms that have energy cost limits that enable efficient and
useful behavioral learning and development throughout their lives. The research
aims to understand how well this constraint works for the continuous behavior
learning and development of robots as in humans. In particular, the synergistic
study of intrinsic motivation, energy preservation, and symbol formation for
continual learning is conducted.

G. Tuba C. Girgin, MS student at the Computer Engineering Department of Bogazici
University, who is experienced with Intrinsic Motivation in Robot Learning and
Symbol Learning, studies computational energy cost (CEC) based on Intrinsic
Motivation and Symbol Formation within the scope of this project. The study will
continue for three months at Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.

T. Baturhan Akbulut is a junior computer engineering student doing a double
major in Mathematics at Bogazici University. He has been undertaking these
tasks:

1. The integration of touch sensors to the robot control system to control the
   facial expressions of the Affetto Robot. By using this system, along with
   Maša Tomšič (Visiting Researcher to SisReC from University of Lisbon) they
   are conducting research on the connection between touch and robotic emotion.
   Besides, this pressure feedback system will be used for artificial pain
   implementation in robots.
2. To enhance robot learning through a demonstration system, the transfer of the
   depth camera display to the VR system to create 1st person view experience
   for intuitive teleoperation of the robot.
3. CNMP(Conditional Neural Movement Primitives) implementation on the robot for
   enhanced soft object manipulation skills.

The study will continue for three months at SisReC, Osaka University, Osaka,
Japan.
