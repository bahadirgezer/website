      "description": "The aim of the course is twofold: To give the student literacy on computers and data processing, and to make him/her a computer user either as a programmer or as an application software packages user.  The course has separate components for these two aims. The first component is the weekly lecture on computer hardware, computer software, applications, computer industry and social issues.  The second component is organized in terms of labs, workshops and recitations.  Students follow one of two alternatives as chosen by their department: 1) programming in a high level language such as Pascal, C or Fortran, 2) the use of a set of application software packages such as word processing, spreadsheet, and data management packages."
